# Advent of Code Project - Scala Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code project! This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges, written in
Scala. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that cover a variety of skill sets and
challenge types.

## Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- The [`main`](src/main) directory contains the Scala solutions for each day.
- The [`test`](src/test) directory includes tests for each day's solutions.
- Inputs for each day's challenges are located in the [`resources`](src/main/resources) directory.

## Solutions

- [Day 1 Solution](src/main/scala/day1/Day1.scala)
- [Day 2 Solution](src/main/scala/day2/Day2.scala)
- [Day 3 Solution](src/main/scala/day3/Day3.scala)
- [Day 4 Solution](src/main/scala/day4/Day4.scala)

## Tests

- [Day 1 Tests](src/test/scala/day1/Day1Test.scala)
- [Day 2 Tests](src/test/scala/day2/Day2Test.scala)
- [Day 3 Tests](src/test/scala/day3/Day3Test.scala)
- [Day 4 Tests](src/test/scala/day4/Day4Test.scala)

Feel free to explore the solutions and tests. Each day's challenge is solved in a dedicated Scala file, ensuring a clean
and organized approach to problem-solving. Enjoy coding!
